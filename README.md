# trulyfreefonts

This project builds a ranked list of the most popular truly free Latin fonts and publishes it at [trulyfreefonts.com](https://trulyfreefonts.com). A font counts as truly free only if its license allows use in all personal and commercial projects, with no use restrictions. Display-only, personal-use-only, demo and non-commercial licenses don't qualify. The first release is the filterable list. A later release compares the list with the fonts a visitor already has and shows the ones they don't have.

## Status

Milestone 1, the catalog pipeline, is in progress. Until the first release, trulyfreefonts.com shows a placeholder page.

- Plan: [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) and the milestone checklists, starting with [docs/milestone-1.md](docs/milestone-1.md).
- How fonts are ranked: [docs/ranking-methodology.md](docs/ranking-methodology.md).
- Settled decisions: [AUTHORITY.md](AUTHORITY.md).

## Development

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). It installs Python 3.14 if you don't have it.

```sh
uv sync                     # create .venv with the locked dependencies
uv run pytest               # run the tests
uv run tff-catalog --help   # the catalog command line
uv run ruff check           # lint
uv run ruff format --check  # formatting
```

CI runs the lint, the tests and a secret scan (gitleaks) on every pull request. It skips tests marked `network`, `store` or `browser`, which need the network, the private snapshot store or a browser.

## Licenses

## Source credits

The rankings are built from data that others publish. Thank you to all of them.

The license column shows each source's license or terms and, where the owner has ruled on them (2026-09-25; see [AUTHORITY.md](AUTHORITY.md)), what we may publish from it. "Terms under review" means we have found no license for the data and no ruling covers it yet.
