# Milestone 1 checklist: build catalog.json (about 500 families)

Milestone 1 builds the ranked, license-checked catalog that the filterable list (Milestone 2) will publish. The method is in [ranking-methodology.md](ranking-methodology.md), and settled decisions go in [AUTHORITY.md](../AUTHORITY.md).

**How to read each step:**

- **Who:** the owner, Claude, or both.
- **Depends on:** the steps that must finish first.
- **Done when:** what must be true before the step is ticked.
- **Parallel:** where Claude can run several agents at once.

Tick each item as soon as it is done and verified. If an item is only partly done, leave it unticked and note what's left.

**Critical path:** 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → (5, 5b, 6a and 7, alongside 8) → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 6b → 13 → 15 → 16 → (17 and 18) → 19 → 20. Step 14 runs alongside steps 8–13.

### Step 0: Owner reviews the ranking methodology
**Who:** owner; Claude answers questions and makes edits. **Depends on:** nothing.
- [ ] Claude opens a pull request adding `docs/ranking-methodology.md` (status: proposal) and this checklist.
- [ ] Claude posts a rough preview in the pull request: the top 50 of the desktop, project and overall ranks, built from the local data of 2026-09-25 with naive name matching and labelled "rough".
- [ ] The owner answers the eleven **DECISION [Step 0]** items and edits any [later OK] default:
  - D1 method;
  - D3 license classes and previews;
  - D4 Latin;
  - D7 Nerd and CJK credit;
  - D8 preinstalled fonts;
  - D10 project scope;
  - D12 overall mix;
  - D13 extra views;
  - D14 evidence gate;
  - D15 snapshot storage;
  - D17 licenses (the data license stays provisional until step 3).
- [ ] If D12 is (a), the owner names 3–5 designer lists (with URLs); otherwise designer picks are set to 0.
- [ ] Claude records each answer in AUTHORITY.md with its date.
- [ ] Claude updates the stale lines in PLAN.md, which stays local and untracked:
  - "reciprocal-rank fusion";
  - "publishes by rsync";
  - "Google Fonts metadata" as a ranking source.
- [ ] Claude marks the methodology "approved"; the owner merges the pull request.

**Done when:** no [Step 0] decision is open, and AUTHORITY.md and both docs are merged to `main`.

### Step 1: Project setup
**Who:** Claude; the owner turns on branch protection. **Depends on:** D17 from step 0; the rest can start during step 0.
- [ ] A uv project on Python 3.14:
  - `pyproject.toml`, `src/tff_catalog/`, `tests/`, and a CLI named `tff-catalog`;
  - dependencies httpx, fonttools, numpy and jsonschema (tomllib is built in);
  - `uv.lock` committed.
- [ ] Layout:
  - `config/`: `ranking.toml`, `licenses.toml`, `preinstalled.toml`, `foundries.toml`, `designer_lists/`;
  - `data/`: `aliases.csv`, `reviews/` (owner rulings);
  - `state/` (see step 3);
  - `build/`: `catalog.json`, `catalog-site.json`, `review.md`.
- [ ] `LICENSE` for code and `LICENSE-DATA` for the catalog, per D17. The data license is marked provisional.
- [ ] A README with source credits.
- [ ] CI on every pull request: `uv run ruff check`, `uv run pytest`, and a secret scan (gitleaks).
- [ ] Owner: branch protection for `main` requiring the CI checks, with **0 required approvals**, because the owner can't approve their own pull requests.
- [ ] Confirm `.gitignore` still excludes `PLAN.md`, `ops/SERVER.local.md` and `.claude/settings.local.json`.

**Done when:** a pull request with one trivial test passes CI, and both license files are on `main`.

### Step 2: Config files
**Who:** Claude writes them; the owner edits values. **Depends on:** 0, 1.
- [ ] `ranking.toml` holds every parameter in the methodology (the §5 tables and §8). It is validated on load, and unknown or missing keys fail.
- [ ] `licenses.toml` sorts licenses into allowed, excluded and owner-ruling classes per D3. Anything not listed is excluded.
- [ ] `preinstalled.toml`, seeded from the research and reviewed by the owner. Seeds:
  - Linux defaults;
  - Cascadia on Windows 11;
  - the macOS list;
  - GNOME's Adwaita fonts;
  - Android;
  - the LibreOffice bundle.
- [ ] `foundries.toml` lists League of Moveable Type, Velvetyne, Collletttivo, Open Foundry and Roundo; the designer lists are added if D12 is (a).
- [ ] `tff-catalog config` prints the effective config and its hash.

**Done when:** the loader tests pass and the owner has reviewed `preinstalled.toml`.

### Step 3: Collector framework, snapshots, run state and source terms
**Who:** Claude; the owner rules on the terms table and posts the Fonts Over Time request. **Depends on:** 1 and D15.
- [ ] A shared fetcher:
  - User-Agent `trulyfreefonts-catalog/<version> (+https://github.com/byronshock/trulyfreefonts)`, never a personal email;
  - retries with backoff;
  - per-host rate limits;
  - conditional GETs.
- [ ] Snapshot store per D15:
  - font-relevant extracts plus a manifest (url, sha256, fetched_at, status) in `<store>/<source>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`;
  - big raw files expire after the run;
  - a size check.
- [ ] Run-state design:
  - `state/` on `main` holds membership counters, first_seen, license hashes, stale counters, last published ranks and snapshot baselines;
  - state advances only when a refresh pull request is merged;
  - a new run replaces an unmerged refresh pull request;
  - test: two runs without a merge give the same state as one run.
- [ ] Stale-data policy: reuse the last snapshot for up to 2 months, flagged.
- [ ] Terms audit, one row per source, recording whether raw values and fixtures may be republished. The result goes in `docs/sources.md`. Rows:
  - Google's undocumented endpoints;
  - Fonts Over Time (no license file);
  - ecosyste.ms (data CC BY-SA 4.0, verified 2026-09-25);
  - the Almanac sheets;
  - Homebrew;
  - pkgstats;
  - popcon;
  - npm;
  - jsDelivr;
  - Chocolatey;
  - GitHub;
  - the designer lists.
- [ ] Claude drafts a request to the Fonts Over Time author for an explicit data license (for example CC BY 4.0); the owner posts it.

**Done when:**
- fetching one real source twice leaves exactly one snapshot per date, with no duplicates;
- the state test passes;
- the owner has ruled on the terms table;
- the data license is final.

**Parallel:** split the terms audit by source.

### Step 4: Candidate universe
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 2, 3.
- [ ] Collectors for:
  - Google Fonts metadata;
  - the google/fonts tree and METADATA.pb files (license folder, repository, minisite);
  - Fontsource;
  - Nerd Fonts `fonts.json`;
  - Homebrew `cask.json`;
  - Fontist formulas;
  - `foundries.toml`.
- [ ] Each family gets a stable `id`, minted from its name at first sighting and never changed. Renames only add aliases. Source memberships and upstream URLs are recorded.
- [ ] Drop non-text families, each with a reason code.

**Done when:**
- a universe report shows every name mapped to a family, with per-source counts and drop reasons;
- ids are identical across two runs;
- a rename test keeps the id.

**Parallel:** one agent per catalog collector.

### Step 5: Latin filter
**Who:** Claude; the owner signs off the allowlist. **Depends on:** 4 and D4.
- [ ] Google families: apply rule A (expect 1,264).
- [ ] Dual-script review sheet: about 30 candidates, sorted by Google year views, with the Latin-language counts from each family's metadata. The owner marks the allowlist.
- [ ] Non-Google fonts:
  - fetch one Regular file per candidate;
  - test it against the GF glyphsets with fontTools;
  - cache the result by file hash;
  - record coverage (basic or latin-ext).
- [ ] Map CJK builds to their Latin parent at `cjk_build_credit`, and exclude families that are mainly CJK.

**Done when:**
- every family has a `latin` field;
- the allowlist is approved;
- spot checks pass: Inter and Iosevka are in; Pretendard and LXGW WenKai are out.

**Parallel:** batch the file tests across agents.

### Step 5b: Font facts
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 4; runs alongside step 5.
- [ ] For every family, including non-Google ones:
  - `category`;
  - `is_monospace` (from `post.isFixedPitch` or panose when no metadata exists);
  - `formats` {variable, static}.

  Sources: GF metadata, Fontsource, or the font's own tables, cached by file hash.

**Done when:** every family has all three fields, and spot checks pass: JetBrains Mono is monospace; Inter is sans and variable.

### Step 6a: License classification (before ranking)
**Who:** Claude; the owner rules on the queue. **Depends on:** 2, 4.
- [ ] L1: map every license string to an SPDX ID through `licenses.toml`.
- [ ] L2: cross-check the google/fonts folder, Fontsource, Fontist, Nerd Fonts, Debian DEP-5 and Arch.
- [ ] Per font, provisionally: class, redistributable, attribution_required and preview_ok (per D3).
- [ ] Review queue for NOASSERTION results, custom texts and disagreements (DejaVu, Hack, Cascadia, OpenDyslexic, URW, Roboto Mono). Owner rulings are saved in `data/reviews/`.

**Done when:** every candidate has a provisional class, and the queue is empty.

### Step 7: Alias table
**Who:** Claude; the owner reviews flagged rows. **Depends on:** 4.
- [ ] `data/aliases.csv`, with columns: alias, family_id, relation, source, first_seen, reviewed_by. Relations:
  - rename, build, package, postscript;
  - sibling;
  - related;
  - **ineligible**, with a reason code (proprietary, ITF, CJK, icon, generic, system).
- [ ] Mine aliases from:
  - google/fonts delisted directories and git history (never pair through googlefontdirectory-hg);
  - Fontsource's legacy names;
  - Nerd Fonts `fonts.json`, keeping one authoritative list of Nerd casks;
  - Homebrew `old_tokens` and `cask_renames`;
  - Arch and Debian package names;
  - a hand-made table of about 60 Chocolatey ids;
  - a GitHub repo-to-family table with a main-download-channel flag;
  - upstream name tables (Inter Variable, Inter Display).
- [ ] Sibling rules that block false matches: Roboto ≠ Roboto Slab, Fira Sans ≠ Fira Code, Inter ≠ Inter Tight, Noto Sans ≠ Noto Sans JP.
- [ ] Auto-accept only renames from google/fonts history and Nerd `unpatchedName` rows; the owner reviews the rest.

**Done when:** the known-answer tests pass and the review queue is empty.

**Parallel:** one agent per alias source.

### Step 8: One collector per ranking source
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 3; runs alongside steps 5–7. Each collector writes a dated snapshot and parsed values, and has a test built from a fixture the terms ruling allows (synthetic if not).
- [ ] Homebrew analytics for 30, 90 and 365 days. Cask add dates come from a blobless clone of homebrew-cask (`git log --diff-filter=A`), not the API.
- [ ] Arch pkgstats: monthly shares for the last 12 complete months, for all font-like packages.
- [ ] Dependency data:
  - Arch core/extra `.db`;
  - the CachyOS and EndeavourOS repository databases;
  - Debian `Packages.xz` and popcon `by_inst.gz`.
- [ ] Debian popcon main/fonts.
- [ ] GitHub releases for main-channel repos (a small `per_page` for Iosevka; at most 24 months), within a per-run GitHub API budget.
- [ ] Nerd Fonts releases.
- [ ] Chocolatey OData.
- [ ] Fonts Over Time weekly JSONL and `latest.csv`, with a column check that marks the source stale on mismatch.
- [ ] Web Almanac 2025 sheets: find the header row, validate the columns, and pin the sheet id and tabs per edition in config.
- [ ] Google Fonts `/metadata/stats`, falling back to the popularity field.
- [ ] npm `downloads/point/last-year` for @fontsource, @fontsource-variable and @expo-google-fonts packages above the floor, at most 1 request a second with backoff on 429.
- [ ] Fontsource `/v1/stats` (jsDelivr).
- [ ] Designer-list loader (if D12 is (a)).
- [ ] Flutter code search: deferred until a token is chosen.

**Done when:** `tff-catalog fetch` runs every collector locally. The Actions run is checked in step 19.

**Parallel:** one agent per collector; the biggest speed-up in the milestone.

### Step 9: Name mapping and unmatched report
**Who:** Claude; the owner reviews the top of the report. **Depends on:** 7, 8.
- [ ] Map every source key to a family id or an ineligible row, and set the four evidence states.
- [ ] `build/unmatched.md` lists keys with no alias row, above each source's floor, sorted by volume. Nothing is guessed.
- [ ] The owner resolves the top entries; new rows go into `aliases.csv`.

**Done when:** no source has an unmatched key in its top 200 (ineligible rows count as resolved), and the known answers pass.

### Step 10: Confound corrections
**Who:** Claude; the owner reviews flagged preinstalled entries. **Depends on:** 8, 9.
- [ ] Reverse-dependency abstentions (at 50% or more), plus abstentions for preinstalled fonts.
- [ ] Noise floors (Homebrew, the Arch Nerd Fonts group, Nerd release downloads), bundle, Nerd and CJK credits, and exposure counted from data dates.
- [ ] A per-font correction report, with new cases flagged for the owner.

**Done when:**
- the owner has reviewed the report;
- Quicksand and DejaVu abstain on Debian, and Hack abstains on Arch;
- Fantasque Sans Mono and Fira Sans have been checked against CachyOS's dependencies.

### Step 11: Per-survey ranking engine
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 2 for building on synthetic fixtures during steps 4–10; 10 for the real run.
- [ ] Ruler built from Homebrew values after the gates, alias-summing and credits.
- [ ] Equating, and the censored value pinned as in the methodology (§3).
- [ ] Weight scaling for small overlaps.
- [ ] Shrunk mean, outlier guard, the two-group gate for the top 100, and deterministic ties.
- [ ] Property tests:
  - determinism;
  - adding an ineligible font moves nothing;
  - a higher count never lowers a rank, except where the guard fires.
- [ ] The worked example (2.48 / 2.15 / 1.98) as a fixture.
- [ ] Cross-checks: coverage-aware RRF (k=60) and the Fontsource ruler.

**Done when:** the tests pass and the desktop and project ranks are produced from real data.

### Step 12: Overall rank, views and membership
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 11.
- [ ] Overall rank with split weights, shrunk once.
- [ ] Views: Coding, Developers & apps, categories, Rising (beta).
- [ ] A test that changing any view's weights leaves the overall rank unchanged.
- [ ] Catalog membership (the top 500 plus each survey's top 100), with hysteresis counters in `state/`.

**Done when:** every catalog candidate has all the published ranks.

### Step 6b: License verification for the catalog (after ranking)
**Who:** Claude; the owner rules on the queue. **Depends on:** 12; on the critical path before step 13.
- [ ] L3, for overall rank 700 or better and each survey's top 150:
  - fetch the upstream license text and match its fingerprint;
  - check name-table IDs 13 and 14;
  - store text_url, sha256, checked_on and font_version.
- [ ] Any font that fails L3 leaves the catalog; rerun the rank.

**Done when:**
- every catalog font is at L3 or has an owner ruling;
- a test shows that a changed license hash puts the font back in the queue.

**Parallel:** Google families in one automatic batch; non-Google upstreams split across agents.

### Step 13: Confidence and stability
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 6b.
- [ ] 200 weight perturbations plus leave-one-source-out runs, giving ranges, tiers and bands.
- [ ] A backtest on historical windows (pkgstats series, 18 months of npm, Homebrew 30/90/365 days, Google's windows), used to set the alert thresholds.

**Done when:** every ranked font has a range and a tier, and the backtest report is committed.

### Step 14: Official download links
**Who:** Claude; the owner approves overrides. **Depends on:** 4, 6a; runs alongside steps 8–13.
- [ ] Google families:
  - primary link: the specimen page;
  - designer link: `minisite_url` or `repository_url`, never googlefontdirectory-hg.
- [ ] An override list (Inter, IBM Plex, JetBrains Mono, the Adobe Source families), approved by the owner.
- [ ] Non-Google fonts:
  - link the designer's homepage or the repository's releases page;
  - never a release asset, `/releases/latest` or an aggregator;
  - auto-accept only when two sources agree.
- [ ] A monthly link check.

**Done when:** every catalog font has a primary link that follows the policy and returns HTTP 200.

**Parallel:** batch the link checks.

### Step 15: catalog.json schema, validation and site export
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 13, 14.
- [ ] A JSON Schema for `catalog.json` (methodology §7), with the hard-failure checks from §9 wired in. The rank keys are versioned constants.
- [ ] `catalog-site.json` for the filterable list, with these fields per font:
  - id, family, category, is_monospace;
  - formats, Latin coverage;
  - license {spdx, class, redistributable, attribution_required, text_url};
  - preview_ok, links, preinstalled_on;
  - rank or band, `order` and tier for each published rank.

  The file also carries the data license and source credits.
- [ ] A monthly diff (entries, exits, big moves, license changes) and the flags, written to `build/review.md`.
- [ ] `docs/catalog-schema.md` documents both files.

**Done when:** both files validate in CI and the hard checks pass on the real run.

### Step 16: First full run and owner review of the top lists
**Who:** both. **Depends on:** 15.
- [ ] Claude prepares a review pack:
  - the top 100 of each rank, with tiers and per-source ranks;
  - fonts held back by the gate;
  - tier-C fonts;
  - the comparison with the old Top 100;
  - desktop-versus-project disagreements;
  - anomalies;
  - the what-if table.
- [ ] The owner reviews and edits `ranking.toml`, the aliases or `preinstalled.toml`; Claude reruns (up to 3 rounds).

**Done when:** the owner approves the lists.

### Step 17: Record decisions
**Who:** both. **Depends on:** 16; runs alongside step 18.
- [ ] AUTHORITY.md gets dated entries for the final method, weights, license rulings and Latin policy.
- [ ] `docs/ranking-methodology.md` becomes the public text, starting from its plain-words section.
- [ ] Confirm every completed item in this checklist is already ticked.

**Done when:** the changes are merged to `main`.

### Step 18: One-command refresh
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 15.
- [ ] `uv run tff-catalog refresh` runs fetch → map → correct → rank → confidence → links → validate → export → `review.md`.
- [ ] `--from-snapshots <date>` replays a run offline.

**Done when:** a clean clone produces identical output from the same snapshots, and the run time is recorded.

### Step 19: Monthly GitHub Actions workflow
**Who:** Claude builds it; the owner sets up access and merges. **Depends on:** 18 and D15.
- [ ] Owner: let refresh pull requests trigger CI. Either:
  - create a GitHub App or fine-grained token for opening them (recommended); or
  - turn on "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" and accept a monthly "Approve and run". The repository currently has it off.
- [ ] Owner: add the secrets:
  - access to the private snapshot store if D15 is (a), with a deploy key or App;
  - a token for Flutter code search only if that is turned on.
- [ ] The workflow:
  - runs on a monthly cron at an off-minute (for example `17 6 3 * *`) and on `workflow_dispatch`;
  - uses a uv cache and a concurrency group;
  - has write permission for `contents`, `pull-requests` and `issues`.
- [ ] It opens or updates a pull request on the fixed branch `refresh/monthly`, with `catalog.json`, `catalog-site.json`, `review.md` and the `state/` changes. A hard failure fails the job and opens an issue instead.
- [ ] Check the collectors on GitHub's runners: rate limits, the GitHub API budget, and whether Google's endpoints respond.
- [ ] A watchdog for GitHub's rule that disables scheduled workflows in public repositories after 60 days without activity: flag it if no refresh pull request has appeared for 35 days.

**Done when:** a manual dispatch opens a correct pull request, CI runs on it, and the owner merges it.

### Step 20: Handoff to Milestone 2
**Who:** both. **Depends on:** 17, 19.
- [ ] `catalog-site.json` v1 is frozen, with a sample file and the schema doc.
- [ ] A handoff note lists what Milestone 2 must settle:
  - the default rank order;
  - numbering under filters;
  - the deploy path to the VPS;
  - the methodology page.
- [ ] The runbook lists the manual tasks (methodology §10).
- [ ] "Current step" in AUTHORITY.md moves to Milestone 2.

**Done when:** the owner accepts the handoff.
