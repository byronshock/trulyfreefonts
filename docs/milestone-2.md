# Milestone 2 checklist: the filterable list goes live

Milestone 2 replaces the stub on trulyfreefonts.com with Milestone 1's ranked, filterable list, plus methodology, privacy and about pages and a tip link, and starts usability testing. Comparing the list with a visitor's own fonts waits for Milestone 3. Settled decisions go in [AUTHORITY.md](../AUTHORITY.md).

**How to read each step:**

- **Who:** the owner, Claude, or both.
- **Depends on:** the steps that must finish first. "M1 step N" is in [milestone-1.md](milestone-1.md), D1–D17 are in [ranking-methodology.md](ranking-methodology.md), and M2-D1 to M2-D11 are under [Decisions](#decisions).
- **Done when:** what must be true before the step is ticked.
- **Parallel:** where Claude can run several agents at once.

Tick each item as soon as it is done and verified. If an item is only partly done, leave it unticked and note what's left.

**Milestone 2 is done when:**
- trulyfreefonts.com serves the filterable list from the latest merged `catalog-site.json`, and the stub is gone;
- every font shows its linked license, official download link, ranks with tiers, per-source ranks and tags;
- "Redistributable fonts only" works as Rule 3 says;
- the methodology, privacy and about pages are live, and the tip link passes the checks in [ops/DONATIONS.md](../ops/DONATIONS.md);
- the live privacy test passes: no request to another site, no cookie, nothing stored in the browser, the CSP enforced, no Cloudflare error-report headers;
- the WCAG 2.2 AA check is clean and the performance budget is met;
- a monthly refresh has reached the live site through the chosen deploy path;
- usability rounds 1 and 2 are done, with no blocker or major finding open;
- nothing has been announced (that is Milestone 4);
- AUTHORITY.md records M2-D1 to M2-D11, and the owner has accepted the handoff.

**Critical path:** 0 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 17. Steps 1–12 run on step 2's sample catalog while Milestone 1 is still building; steps 13–16 need its real data.

### Step 0: Owner reviews this checklist
**Who:** owner; Claude answers questions and makes edits. **Depends on:** nothing; it can run during Milestone 1. Only M2-D5 (d) waits on a Milestone 1 decision (D3).
- [x] Claude opens a pull request adding this checklist. ([#2](https://github.com/byronshock/trulyfreefonts/pull/2))
- [x] The owner answers the seven **[Step 0]** decisions (M2-D1 to M2-D7) *(all answered 2026-09-25; [later OK] defaults kept)* and changes any **[later OK]** default (M2-D8, M2-D10, M2-D11); M2-D9 was decided on 2026-09-25. With step 7, they cover M1 step 20's handoff list.
- [ ] *(Partly done 2026-09-25: every answer recorded; `docs/milestone-2.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` added to Tracked docs. Left: `docs/usability-test.md`, when step 12 creates it.)* Claude records each answer in AUTHORITY.md with its date, adds `docs/milestone-2.md`, `docs/usability-test.md` (step 12) and, if not yet listed, `docs/roadmap.md` to "Tracked docs", and updates PLAN.md's Milestone 2 line if needed.
- [x] The owner merges the pull request. *(Merged by Claude at the owner's request, 2026-09-25.)*

**Done when:** no [Step 0] decision is open, and AUTHORITY.md and this file are merged to `main`.

### Step 1: Site skeleton and build
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 0 (M2-D3); M1 step 1 under M2-D3 (a).
- [ ] `site/` (templates, one stylesheet, one script, static files) builds into `build/site/` (gitignored); the stub in `public/` stays live until step 14.
- [ ] `uv run tff-site build` (M2-D3 (a)) checks the data against M1 step 15's schema, writes the default rank (M2-D1) into `index.html`, hashes asset names (`/assets/<name>.<hash>.<ext>`), writes `version.txt` (commit, run date) and makes no network requests.
- [ ] A local preview server sends the Caddyfile's headers.
- [ ] Per page: `lang="en"`, title, meta description, canonical URL. Site-wide: `robots.txt` (the live copy must match the repo's, since Cloudflare's Bot Preference Sync adds lines when an AI bot policy blocks or disallows), `sitemap.xml`, a favicon, a 404 page (Caddy `handle_errors`) and a share image on our own domain. The interface uses the system font stack.
- [ ] CI on every pull request builds from the sample and runs the Playwright tests of steps 3, 6, 9 and 10 (Playwright never ships).

**Done when:** CI builds from the sample, two builds are byte-identical, and the local preview shows the ranked list.

### Step 2: Approve the site data and build a sample
**Who:** Claude; the owner approves. **Depends on:** 0; runs alongside step 1. M1 step 20 freezes `catalog-site.json` v1 only after this approval.
- [ ] The owner approves the `catalog-site.json` fields M1 step 15 lists for this milestone: aliases, per-source states, ranges, flags, designer lists, `preview` and run metadata.
- [ ] If step 10's budget requires it, per-source data moves to `catalog-details.json`, fetched when a details panel first opens.
- [ ] `tests/fixtures/catalog-site.sample.json`, the sample M1 step 20 freezes with v1: about 40 labelled-synthetic fonts covering ranks and bands, tiers A–C, no deliberate-install evidence, not redistributable, attribution required, limited accents, each system's preinstalls, a package dependency, no preview, a very long name, and a font found only by alias.

**Done when:** the owner has approved the fields, and the sample passes M1 step 15's schema (a draft until that step lands).

### Step 3: The list: ranks, filters, search and sorting
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 1, 2; M2-D1, M2-D2, M2-D4; D3, D4, D6, D10, D13.
- [ ] A rank selector: Overall; Desktop *most chosen*; Desktop *most installed*; Used in projects (the Project rank, D10); and D13's views (Coding, Developers & apps, and Rising (beta) once it has 3 months of history). One line says what the rank measures; "By category" is the category filter on Overall.
- [ ] Each row: rank or band, name, specimen or fallback text (step 5), category, license, badges (variable, monospace, limited accents, attribution required, not redistributable, preinstalled on …), the official download link and a details button.
- [ ] Numbers follow M2-D2: each filtered list counts from 1. Fonts past the rank's exact top 100 show their band ("101–250", "251–500") instead of a number, in `order`. Fonts unranked in the view come last, unnumbered, with a reason: in *most chosen*, "no evidence of deliberate installs" plus the `preinstalled_on` or `pulled_in_by` tag. Coding lists monospace fonts only.
- [ ] Filters, laid out per M2-D4: category; spacing: Any / Proportional / Monospaced (replaces D13's "Text only" and a monospace-only box); variable; hide limited accents (D4); license class (D3); hide attribution required; hide fonts that come with Windows, macOS, Linux or Android; **"Redistributable fonts only"** (Rule 3), off by default, with a line on what redistributing means.
- [ ] Search over names and aliases by `search_key` (NFKC, case-fold, drop spaces, hyphens and underscores, strip accents), so "Source Sans Pro" finds Source Sans 3. Its test vectors later move into M3 step 3's shared file.
- [ ] Sort by rank (default) or name, with a count ("Showing 48 of 540 fonts"), "Clear filters", and a no-results message naming filters to loosen.
- [ ] The view lives in the URL after `#` (`#rank=project&cat=serif&redist=1`): links reproduce it, Back works, nothing is stored, and that part never reaches the server.
- [ ] Without JavaScript, the built default list shows, with a note that filters need it.
- [ ] Browser tests: filtering, numbering, band order, alias search, restoring a view from its URL.

**Done when:**
- every rank and filter works on the sample and the latest real run, and the tests pass;
- "Redistributable fonts only" hides exactly the fonts with `redistributable: false`;
- a copied URL opens the same view in a fresh browser.

**Parallel:** steps 5, 7, 9, 11 and 12 can each run in their own agent.

### Step 4: Font details
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 3; D12; M1 steps 6b, 13 and 14.
- [ ] Details open inside the list, and each font has its own link (`#font=inter`).
- [ ] License name and SPDX id, linked to `text_url`; "Redistributable: yes/no" with a plain line on its meaning; what to credit, if required.
- [ ] Official and designer download links naming their destination ("GitHub: rsms/inter"); no font-file links (M1 step 14).
- [ ] Every published rank with tier and range (a band past #100), a line if the two-group gate held the font back, and per-source ranks with their state (observed, below the floor, not covered, too new), each source linked to its credit on the methodology page.
- [ ] Tags: preinstalled on, pulled in by, variable or static, Latin coverage, designer lists (if D12 is (a)), "also known as".
- [ ] "Report a problem with this font": step 12's license form, prefilled with the font's id and data date, plus the email fallback.

**Done when:** for 10 fonts the owner picks, every field matches `catalog.json` and every license and download link returns HTTP 200 (M1 step 14's monthly check covers the rest).

### Step 5: Font previews
**Who:** Claude; the owner picks the sample text. **Depends on:** 1, 2; M2-D5; D3 (`preview_ok`); M1 steps 6b (each family's `font_file` {url, sha256}) and 18. M2-D5 chose (b), so every item applies.
- [ ] A `specimens` stage in `tff-catalog refresh`, after the license and link stages: for each `preview_ok` font, fetch `font_file.url`, check its sha256 (a mismatch means a flag and no image), set the sample with HarfBuzz, and save the outlines to `build/specimens/<id>.svg`. No font file is served or committed.
- [ ] Sample: the family name plus an accented (Latin Extended) or basic-Latin line, never a missing-glyph box (a failing font gets a flag); variable fonts at Regular (400), else their default instance. Output is byte-stable, so a refresh changes only fonts that changed.
- [ ] Budget: half at 5 KB compressed or less, none over 30 KB (else the family name only), all under 10 MB.
- [ ] Served as immutable `/assets/specimens/<id>.<hash>.svg` files, drawn as a CSS `mask-image` filled with `currentColor` (`CanvasText` with `forced-color-adjust: none` under forced colors), so they read in every theme within `img-src 'self'`. Accessible name "<family> sample", with the name also in text.
- [ ] The script sets each mask as its row nears the screen, in a fixed-size box; `<noscript>` images load lazily. The loader can pause, for M3-D10 (previews after a comparison).
- [ ] Fallbacks: "No preview: this font's license doesn't let us host its files. See it on <official page>." (no `preview_ok`); "Preview not available yet." (render failed).
- [ ] Under M2-D5 (b), "Type your own text" loads the unchanged upstream file on request, after showing its size. The deploy fetches the files and checks `font_file.sha256`; they are never committed and get no CORS headers.

**Done when:**
- every `preview_ok` font has a specimen or a flag saying why not;
- the budget check passes in CI;
- the owner has checked the top 100 in light, dark and forced-colors modes.

### Step 6: Layout, themes and accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
**Who:** Claude; the owner or a tester does one screen-reader pass. **Depends on:** 3, 4, 5.
- [ ] A table-like list on wide screens and cards on phones, with no sideways scrolling at 320 CSS px (1.4.10); on phones, one "Filters" button that shows how many are on.
- [ ] Light or dark follows the system (no switch, since nothing is stored); forced colors work; `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected.
- [ ] Landmarks, one `h1`, a skip link, and each font a list item with its own heading; native, labelled controls, with fieldset and legend for filter groups.
- [ ] Each change announces the new count politely (4.1.3) and keeps focus. Everything works by keyboard, with a 3:1 focus outline that no sticky header hides (2.4.11).
- [ ] Contrast in both themes: 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text and controls (1.4.3, 1.4.11). Targets at least 24 × 24 CSS px (2.5.8); 200% zoom and text spacing don't break the layout (1.4.4, 1.4.12). Links name their destination, and the feedback link keeps one place on every page (3.2.6).
- [ ] axe-core via Playwright on every page, in both themes, at phone and desktop widths, with filters on and a details panel open; in CI from here on.
- [ ] Manual passes: keyboard only, and Orca with Firefox; VoiceOver on an iPhone or NVDA if a tester has one.

**Done when:** axe reports 0 violations in CI, the manual passes leave no WCAG 2.2 AA failure open, and the results are in the pull request.

**Parallel:** the automated and manual checks.

### Step 7: Methodology, privacy and about pages
**Who:** Claude writes; the owner approves. **Depends on:** 1; M2-D9; M1 steps 3 (terms ruling, data license) and 17 (public text); D1, D10, D12, D13, D17.
- [ ] `/methodology`, generated at build time from `docs/ranking-methodology.md` so they can't drift: §1 in plain words; the two desktop views and why; reading ranks, bands and tiers; known biases (§11); source credits (what each measures, link, license); data (D17) and code licenses; run date, method version and stale sources; a link to the full text.
- [ ] `/privacy`: no cookies, analytics, browser storage or requests to other sites; "Check for yourself" in the Network tab of Firefox, Chrome and Safari (only trulyfreefonts.com should appear); what the server and Cloudflare log, and for how long (M2-D9); a link to `ops/Caddyfile`; a promise that Milestone 3's check keeps your font list on your device.
- [ ] `/about`: what the site is; Rules 1–4 in plain words, including why ITF-licensed fonts are out; what's next; how to report a problem or get in touch.
- [ ] Near the list, linked to `/privacy`: "No cookies, no tracking, and the page loads only its own files. Check the Network tab."

**Done when:** the owner has approved the text, the pages pass step 6's checks, and the credits match M1 step 3's terms ruling.

### Step 8: Tip link
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 1. [ops/DONATIONS.md](../ops/DONATIONS.md) steps 1–10 are done; the live link is in its Facts table (2026-09-25).
- [ ] Do DONATIONS.md step 11, ticking it there: one plain link, no Stripe script or cookies, after the results and in the footer, called a tip, not a donation.
- [ ] Step 9's test sees no Stripe request before a click; the headers need no change.

**Done when:** DONATIONS.md's Verification lines pass on the test site, then on the live site at step 14.

### Step 9: Privacy: headers, Cloudflare settings and logs
**Who:** Claude, over SSH and the Cloudflare API; the owner does what the token can't. **Depends on:** 1 (page tests only). The Cloudflare items can be done now, on the stub.
- [ ] Headers in `ops/Caddyfile`:
  - a CSP with no inline code: `default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; manifest-src 'self'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'`;
  - `Permissions-Policy` turning off unused features, including `local-fonts=()` (M3 step 6 allows `self` on `/check/` only);
  - `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`: `same-origin`;
  - `no-transform` on HTML (step 11), so Cloudflare can't rewrite pages even if a setting changes;
  - the current HSTS, `nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.
- [x] Via `ops/cf.sh`, on all three zones: Email Address Obfuscation off (it was on and injected a script); Rocket Loader and Always Online kept off; Browser Cache TTL "Respect Existing Headers" (was 4 hours). *(Done 2026-09-25; [ops/SERVER.md](../ops/SERVER.md) item 19.)*
- [x] Owner, in the dashboard: Web Analytics' automatic setup disabled (it was on by default, and injecting the beacon into browser requests on 2026-09-25); Bot Fight Mode off (it sets `__cf_bm`). Steps are in [ops/SERVER.md](../ops/SERVER.md) items 20–21. Cloudflare Fonts and Speed Brain were confirmed off via the API, and no Zaraz script appears in the page. *(Done and verified from outside 2026-09-25.)*
- [x] Network Error Logging off on all three zones, and the access log per M2-D9 (done 2026-09-25; [ops/SERVER.md](../ops/SERVER.md) section F). The live test below and step 14's SERVER.md checks re-verify them.
- [ ] A Playwright test (Chromium, Firefox) loads every page, applies filters, opens details and scrolls every specimen into view, failing on any request to another site, cookie, browser-storage write or CSP violation. It runs in CI and after each deploy on the live site, where it also checks headers (CSP present; no `set-cookie`, `nel` or `report-to`) and that the HTML has no `/cdn-cgi/` path. If M3-D13 (browser storage) stores anything, Milestone 3 turns the storage check into a key allowlist.

**Done when:** the test passes through Cloudflare on the test site (or live, under M2-D7 (b)), and the Network tab in Firefox and Chrome shows only trulyfreefonts.com.

**Parallel:** the Cloudflare items can run alongside everything else.

### Step 10: Performance budget
**Who:** Claude. **Depends on:** 3, 4, 5.
- [ ] CI fails the build if the list page's HTML, CSS and JavaScript exceed 100 KB compressed, the catalog data exceeds 100 KB compressed (per-source data then moves to step 2's details file), or specimens break step 5's budget or load before their row nears the screen.
- [ ] The list page in Playwright, CPU slowed 4× on slow 4G: LCP ≤ 2.5 s, CLS ≤ 0.1, TBT ≤ 200 ms.
- [ ] A filter or rank change redraws the full catalog within 200 ms under the same slowdown.

**Done when:** the budgets pass in CI, and the load-speed numbers pass through Cloudflare on the test site (or live, under M2-D7 (b)).

### Step 11: Deploy, caching and the test site
**Who:** Claude; the owner creates the GitHub environments and secrets (or lets Claude, with `gh`) and adds the Cache Rule. **Depends on:** 1, 9; M2-D6, M2-D7, M2-D11.
- [ ] Caching, per M2-D11: hashed `/assets/` files get `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`, and the owner adds the Cache Rule the token can't ("URI path starts with `/assets/`: eligible for cache, use the origin's Cache-Control"), since Cloudflare caches neither JSON nor HTML by default. Under (a), HTML, `version.txt` and other unhashed files get `no-cache, no-transform`, and deploys need no purge; under (b), HTML gets `s-maxage=300` and `stale-if-error`, the Cache Rule also covers it, and each deploy purges it with a Zone · Cache Purge token (an Actions secret under M2-D6 (b)).
- [ ] Each deploy uploads to `/srv/trulyfreefonts/releases/<commit>/` (the stub moves there first), then switches the `/srv/trulyfreefonts/public` symlink in one step. Three releases are kept, so a rollback is one command.
- [ ] `ops/deploy.sh`, run from the laptop: build, check, upload, switch, then step 9's live test; the fallback under M2-D6 (b).
- [ ] Under M2-D6 (b):
  - a `deploy` user with no password, sudo or shell, in `AllowUsers` (keep a second SSH session open against lockout), its key forced to an `ops/` script that only uploads and switches releases; if D15 is (b), it can't reach the snapshot store;
  - GitHub environments `production` (`main` only) and `staging` holding the key, pinned host key and server address as secrets;
  - a workflow on each push to `main`, or dispatched with a commit to roll back: build → tests → upload → switch → live test, with actions pinned by SHA, `contents: read`, one deploy at a time, and an issue on failure;
  - tests that the key can't open a shell, read other files or write outside `releases/`.
- [ ] Under M2-D7 (a), `staging.trulyfreefonts.com`: a proxied DNS record (the origin certificate covers it); a Caddy block rooted at `/srv/trulyfreefonts/staging/` with the same headers plus `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`; deployed from the `staging` branch by a key that writes only there.
- [ ] Caddyfile changes still use the checked line at the top of that file, never Actions.
- [ ] [ops/SERVER.md](../ops/SERVER.md) gets a deploy, rollback and test-site runbook in place of the rsync line.

**Done when:**
- a deploy while a loop fetches the page every 100 ms causes no errors, and no page mixes old and new files;
- a rollback takes one command and restores the previous `version.txt`;
- under M2-D6 (b), a push to `main` deploys with no manual step, and the key tests pass;
- under M2-D7 (a), the test site is up and sends `noindex`.

### Step 12: Feedback channels and the usability test plan
**Who:** Claude drafts; the owner recruits and runs sessions. **Depends on:** 0 (M2-D10); runs alongside 3–11.
- [ ] Per M2-D10, in one footer spot on every page:
  - issue forms in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, each applying its own labels: `license.yml` ("Wrong license or link", prefilled by field id with the font's id and data date), `missing-font.yml`, `usability.yml` and `bug.yml` (M3 step 8 adds `wrong-match.yml`);
  - `config.yml`: blank issues off, and a contact link for people without GitHub;
  - an email link to the site's `admin@` address, with a subject.
- [ ] `research/` added to `.gitignore`, for raw session notes.
- [ ] `docs/usability-test.md`:
  - **Tasks** (20–30 minutes): (1) a popular free coding monospace that can also ship in an app; (2) a body-text serif with Polish or Vietnamese accents; (3) is Inter free for commercial use, and where do you get it? (4) hide your computer's own fonts; (5) switch to fonts installed on purpose: why did the list change? (6) why does <font> rank above <font>, and how sure is the site? (7) on a phone, open a handwriting font's download page; (8) send this exact view to a friend; (9) what's missing? Would you paste a command's output to hide your fonts, and come back monthly?
  - **Measures:** per task, unaided, helped or failed, and 1–7 ease; problems rated blocker, major or minor; quotes. No recordings without consent; no analytics.
  - **Participants:** 5 new people per round (designers, developers, casual users), at least 2 on phones and 1 keyboard-only or screen-reader user if possible, invited by direct message from the owner's contacts and communities, never in Milestone 4's launch channels (M4-D2).
  - **Sessions:** remote video, thinking aloud, the owner guiding and taking notes (tasks by email for those who can't join); a consent script at the start; findings anonymized (P1, P2 …).
- [ ] Each finding becomes an issue labelled `usability`, with severity and no names.

**Done when:** the owner has approved the script and invitation, a test issue through each form arrives with the right labels, and round 1's testers are booked.

### Step 13: Usability round 1, before launch
**Who:** the owner runs sessions; Claude writes up and fixes findings. **Depends on:** 3–7, 9, 11, 12; real data from M1 step 16 or later, even before the freeze.
- [ ] A trial session checks the script; fix it.
- [ ] 5 sessions on the test site (under M2-D7 (b), a laptop build shared on screen).
- [ ] Claude turns notes into issues grouped by theme; the owner confirms severities.
- [ ] Every blocker and major is fixed or ruled out by the owner with a reason; revisit M2-D4 or the wording if testers stumbled there.

**Done when:**
- 5 sessions are done, with no blocker or major open;
- at least 4 of 5 testers completed tasks 1, 2, 3 and 7 unaided, or each failing task's fix has been checked with 2 more people.

**Parallel:** Claude writes up each session while the next is scheduled.

### Step 14: Soft launch: the list replaces the stub
**Who:** Claude deploys; the owner gives the go-ahead. **Depends on:** 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13; M2-D8; M1 step 20 (`catalog-site.json` v1 frozen from a merged refresh). Launching without the tip link needs an owner ruling in AUTHORITY.md, whose Funding section ties the link to this release.
- [ ] Final checks on the test site: all CI checks, step 9's live test, step 10's numbers, the tip link.
- [ ] The page says it is an early version and that hiding the fonts you have is coming.
- [ ] Deploy to production, and remove the stub from `public/` in the repository.
- [ ] On the live site: SERVER.md's and DONATIONS.md's Verification lines, step 9's live test, and `version.txt` matching the merged commit and run date. Tick DONATIONS.md step 12, with its deploy line changed to M2-D6's path.
- [ ] Search engines per M2-D8 (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`).
- [ ] No announcement before Milestone 4 (no Show HN, Reddit, newsletters or awesome-list pull requests); telling testers and linking from the README are fine.
- [ ] AUTHORITY.md: the soft-launch date under Releases, and "Current step".

**Done when:** the live site passes every check above, and the owner has checked it on a phone and a computer.

### Step 15: Usability rounds 2 and 3, on the live site
**Who:** both. **Depends on:** 14.
- [ ] Round 2: 5 new testers, same tasks, more on phones and assistive technology; fix blockers and majors.
- [ ] Round 3, only if round 2 found a blocker or more than 3 majors: 3 testers check the fixes.
- [ ] Review everything sent by issue form or email since the soft launch.
- [ ] Note for Milestone 3 who would use the paste path and the Chromium button, and what they expect; for Milestone 4, what must be fixed before the announcement.

**Done when:** no blocker or major is open, and the notes are in step 17's handoff.

### Step 16: The first monthly refresh reaches the live site
**Who:** Claude; the owner merges. **Depends on:** 11, 14; M1 step 19.
- [ ] CI on the refresh pull request (M1 step 19) also builds and tests the site, so a catalog that breaks the page can't merge.
- [ ] After the merge the site updates by itself (M2-D6 (b)) or by `ops/deploy.sh` (a); the live `version.txt` shows the new run date.
- [ ] Only fonts whose files changed get new specimens; old ones leave with old releases.
- [ ] Usage baseline without analytics: Claude adds `ops/*.local.md` to `.gitignore`; each refresh, Cloudflare's monthly requests and unique visitors go into `ops/USAGE.local.md` for Milestone 4's two-month review (M4-D4), read by the owner from the dashboard or fetched by Claude if the token gains Analytics read.

**Done when:** one refresh has gone from merge to live site with no step beyond the merge (or one command under M2-D6 (a)), and the post-deploy test has passed.

### Step 17: Record decisions and hand off to Milestones 3 and 4
**Who:** both. **Depends on:** 15, 16.
- [ ] AUTHORITY.md has dated entries for M2-D1 to M2-D11, including any that testing changed.
- [ ] SERVER.md covers the deploy, test site, headers and Cloudflare settings.
- [ ] Handoff note for Milestone 3: the aliases and step 3's `search_key` vectors; `connect-src 'self'` stays, since matching runs on the device; `local-fonts` stays off except on `/check/` (M3 step 6); the specimen loader's pause (step 5); the test site; and what rounds 2 and 3 learned about pasting a command's output.
- [ ] Handoff note for Milestone 4: the usage baseline, open issues, what must be done before the announcement, the deploy path (M2-D6) to revisit at the two-month review, and the caching choice (M2-D11) with the outage result M4 step 4 should expect.
- [ ] Update the Milestone 2 and 3 status lines in `docs/roadmap.md`.
- [ ] Confirm every completed item here is ticked.
- [ ] "Current step" in AUTHORITY.md moves to Milestone 3.

**Done when:** the owner accepts the handoff.

## Decisions

Defaults are in bold. A **[Step 0]** decision is answered before building starts; a **[later OK]** one starts from its default and can change later; a decided one shows its date.

| Decision | Options |
|---|---|
| **M2-D1 (decided 2026-09-25): default rank** on first load | **Overall**, the plainest answer to "the most popular truly free fonts". (Other options were Desktop *most chosen* or Project.) |
| **M2-D2 (decided 2026-09-25): rank numbers under filters** (bands stay bands) | **Renumber 1, 2, 3 …** within each filtered list; fonts past the exact top 100 show their band instead. (Other options were keeping the rank's own numbers, or both.) |
| **M2-D3 (decided 2026-09-25): page technology** | **Plain HTML, CSS and one script, no framework**, built by `tff-site` in the uv project: one toolchain, nothing from npm. (Other options were Hugo/Eleventy or Svelte/Preact with Vite.) |
| **M2-D4 (decided 2026-09-25): filter layout** (round 1 may change it) | **Every filter in a sidebar** on wide screens; on phones, all but search and rank behind one "Filters" button. (The other option kept only search, rank, category and "Redistributable fonts only" visible.) |
| **M2-D5 (decided 2026-09-25): font previews.** Under D3, only `preview_ok` (redistributable) fonts get one, and no trimmed or converted font file is served. | **SVG specimens drawn at each refresh (step 5), plus "Type your own text"**, which loads the unchanged upstream file on request after showing its size. Other fonts get fallback text and their official link. (Other options were specimens only, or loading font files as rows scroll in.) |
| **M2-D6 (decided 2026-09-25): deploy path**, also for Milestones 3 and 4, revisited at Milestone 4's two-month review | **GitHub Actions deploys each push to `main`** as a restricted `deploy` user (step 11); merged refreshes go live with no further step, and `ops/deploy.sh` from the laptop is the fallback. |
| **M2-D7 (decided 2026-09-25): a test site before launch** | **`staging.trulyfreefonts.com`** (step 11): round 1 runs there and Milestone 3 reuses it. |
| **M2-D8 [later OK]: search engines during the soft launch** | **(a) Indexing allowed**; only announcements wait for Milestone 4; (b) `noindex` until Milestone 4. |
| **M2-D9 (decided 2026-09-25): server logs.** Recorded in AUTHORITY.md (Infrastructure) and [ops/SERVER.md](../ops/SERVER.md) section F. Binding on later milestones: M4 step 3 checks the log against it, and any count Milestone 4 takes from the log runs within 14 days. | Caddy masks visitor IPs to /16 (IPv4) and /32 (IPv6) and drops the port and the `Cf-Connecting-Ip` and `X-Forwarded-For` headers; Caddy's rolling is off, and logrotate keeps 14 days, rotated daily (`ops/Caddyfile`, `ops/logrotate-caddy`). Usage totals come from Cloudflare. |
| **M2-D10 [later OK]: feedback channels** | **(a) GitHub issue forms plus an email link to the site's `admin@` address** for people without GitHub (expect some spam); (b) issues only; (c) email only. |
| **M2-D11 [later OK]: caching pages at Cloudflare.** Hashed assets are cached either way; M4 step 4 verifies the choice and records its outage test as the expected result. | **(a) HTML not edge-cached:** no purges or purge permission, but while the server is down visitors see Cloudflare's error page (not customizable on the Free plan); (b) HTML edge-cached and purged after each deploy (step 11), so pages survive a short outage. |
