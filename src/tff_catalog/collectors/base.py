"""The collector contract (design-m1 §2.2). Frozen contract.

A collector is a module ``collectors/{universe,ranking}/<name>.py`` exposing
``COLLECTOR``, an object satisfying ``Collector``. It has two halves:

- ``fetch(ctx)`` talks to the network through ``ctx.fetcher`` (scoped to
  ``hosts``) and writes extracts into ``ctx.out``. Only extracts are kept.
- ``parse(ctx)`` turns one snapshot into records: offline, pure and
  deterministic. It never reads aliases, state or other sources, and must
  accept every extract format up to ``version``.

Each collector's settings are a frozen dataclass ``Settings``, loaded strictly
from ``config/sources/<name>.toml`` by ``load_settings``.

Two conventions every collector follows (the contract test checks both):

- ``Settings`` has a field ``enabled: bool``: the fetch and parse stages run
  only enabled collectors. Subclassing ``CollectorBase.Settings`` gives it.
- ``fetch()`` records every request it makes in the manifest, by calling
  ``ctx.out.record_fetch(result.to_record(kept=...))`` right after each
  ``ctx.fetcher`` call (``kept=True`` when the body itself is saved as an
  extract). The fetcher does not record on its own.

Collector modules keep heavy imports (numpy, fontTools) inside functions, so
discovery (``tff-catalog config --strict``, the contract test) stays fast.
