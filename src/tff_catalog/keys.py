"""Name keys shared by the catalog, the site search and owned-font matching.

The shared vector file ``tests/vectors/name-keys.json`` is the source of truth.
This module and the site's JavaScript port must both reproduce every case in it.

- ``match_key(s)``: NFKC, casefold, NFKC, drop every code point in
  ``DROP_CODEPOINTS``, NFC. Accents are kept: ``"Łódź Sans" -> "łódźsans"``.
- ``search_key(s)``: ``match_key(s)``, NFD, drop general category Mn, NFC.
  Accents are stripped: ``"Łódź Sans" -> "łodzsans"``.

Both functions are idempotent and depend only on the standard library, so the
site build can import this module without the pipeline's dependencies.

JavaScript has no casefold: the port uses the vector file's
``spec.casefold_extra`` table for the code points where Python's casefold
differs from ``toLowerCase()`` (Cherokee, Greek iota subscripts, old Cyrillic
variants and a few more), and ``toLowerCase()`` for the rest, with sharp s folded
to "ss" and final sigma to medial sigma.
